    We do not collect your private messages, email address, password, or watch history.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use your public TikTok content solely to analyze themes, moods, and interests

    profiling, or resale to third parties.

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is stored temporarily and processed only during your session. We do not retain your TikTok data
